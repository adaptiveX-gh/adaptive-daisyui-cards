# Story DS-1: Intelligent Search Infrastructure - Implementation Context

## Story Overview
**As a** data scientist  
**I want** to search for canvas elements using keywords and partial matches  
**So that** I can quickly find specific indicators, datasets, or selection methods without browsing categories.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search bar positioned above categories with real-time filtering
- [ ] Fuzzy search algorithm supporting partial matches and synonyms
- [ ] Search result highlighting with match indicators
- [ ] Search performance under 100ms for all queries
- [ ] Search history maintained within browser session
- [ ] Empty state handling with suggested searches
- [ ] Search analytics tracking for improvement insights

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Client-side search index for instant response
- [ ] Synonym mapping (e.g., "moving average" â†’ "MA", "EMA")
- [ ] Search result ranking based on relevance and usage frequency
- [ ] Debounced search input to prevent excessive API calls
- [ ] Search state management with browser history integration

## HyperEdge Architecture Context
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend**: Fastify with TypeBox validation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Patterns**: Follow existing patterns from apps/api/src/routes/config-fastify.ts
- **Performance**: Target <100ms search response time
- **Caching**: Use Redis with @hyperedge/cache module

## Existing Modal Infrastructure
The "Add Element to Canvas" modal exists and needs enhancement with search functionality.
