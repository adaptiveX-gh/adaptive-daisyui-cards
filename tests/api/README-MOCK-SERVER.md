# Mock SSE Server for Testing Progressive Card Rendering

## Overview

The mock SSE server simulates realistic Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming for testing progressive card rendering without requiring the full API backend. It's specifically designed to test edge cases like:

- Multi-chunk delivery (skeleton arrives in chunk #2+)
- Multi-line JSON data fields
- CRLF vs LF line endings
- Mid-stream errors
- Configurable delays and timing

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Mock Server

```bash
# Standard mode
npm run api:mock

# Development mode (auto-restart on changes)
npm run api:mock:dev

# Alternative
npm run test:sse
```

The server will start on **http://localhost:3001**

### 2. Open the Test Page

Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/tests/api/streaming-progressive.html**

Or open the HTML file directly in your browser.

### 3. Configure the Test

1. Select **"Mock Server (localhost:3001)"** from the endpoint dropdown
2. Choose a test mode:
   - **Chunked (realistic)** - Simulates real-world streaming with progress in chunk #1, skeleton in chunk #2
   - **Multi-line JSON** - Tests parser's ability to handle multi-line `data:` fields
   - **CRLF Line Endings** - Tests Windows-style line endings (`\r\n`)
   - **Error Mid-Stream** - Simulates an error during content generation
   - **Fast (no delays)** - Rapid streaming for performance testing

4. Adjust parameters (cards, delay, etc.)
5. Click **"Start Streaming"**

## API Endpoints

### GET /mock/stream

Main streaming endpoint with query parameters.

**Query Parameters:**
```
delay        - Delay between chunks in ms (default: 500)
cards        - Number of cards to generate (default: 3)
mode         - chunked, multiline, crlf, error, fast
includeHeartbeat - true/false (default: false)
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Realistic streaming with 3 cards, 500ms delay
curl http://localhost:3001/mock/stream?delay=500&cards=3

# Fast streaming with 5 cards
curl "http://localhost:3001/mock/stream?delay=50&cards=5&mode=fast"

# Test multi-line JSON parsing
curl "http://localhost:3001/mock/stream?mode=multiline"

# Test CRLF line endings
curl "http://localhost:3001/mock/stream?mode=crlf"

# Test error handling
curl "http://localhost:3001/mock/stream?mode=error"
```

### GET /mock/demo

Simple demo endpoint that sends 5 events with 1s delay.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/mock/demo
```

### GET /mock/health

Health check endpoint.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/mock/health
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "server": "mock-sse-server",
  "endpoints": [...]
}
```

## Event Sequence

The mock server sends events in this order:

### 1. Progress Event (Chunk #1)
```
id: 1
event: progress
data: {"stage":"skeleton","progress":10,"message":"Generating card structure"}

```

### 2. Skeleton Event (Chunk #2) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
```
id: 2
event: message
data: {"stage":"skeleton","cards":[{"id":"mock-card-1","layout":"hero"}],...}

```

### 3. Progress Event (Chunk #3)
```
id: 3
event: progress
data: {"stage":"content","progress":50,"message":"Generating content"}

```

### 4. Content Events (Multiple Chunks)
```
id: 4
event: message
data: {"stage":"content","cardId":"mock-card-1","section":"title","content":"Mock Card 1 Title"}

id: 5
event: message
data: {"stage":"content","cardId":"mock-card-1","section":"body","content":"This is mock content..."}

```

### 5. Progress Event
```
id: N
event: progress
data: {"stage":"style","progress":90,"message":"Applying styles"}

```

### 6. Style Events
```
id: N+1
event: message
data: {"stage":"style","cardId":"mock-card-1","styles":{"theme":{...}}}

```

### 7. Complete Event
```
id: N+M
event: complete
data: {"cardCount":3,"stages":3,"completedAt":"..."}

```

## Testing Edge Cases

### Test 1: Multi-Chunk Skeleton Delivery

**Purpose:** Verify parser handles skeleton arriving in chunk #2

```bash
# In browser: Select "Chunked (realistic)" mode
# Watch Event Log - you should see:
# - Chunk #1: progress event
# - Chunk #2: skeleton event with cards array
# - Cards render after chunk #2 arrives
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Progress event arrives first (no cards rendered)
- Skeleton event arrives in chunk #2
- Cards with shimmer animation appear
- Content fills in progressively

### Test 2: Multi-Line JSON

**Purpose:** Verify parser joins multi-line `data:` fields

```bash
# In browser: Select "Multi-line JSON" mode
# Console should show successful parsing of multi-line data
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Parser accumulates multiple `data:` lines
- Joins them before JSON.parse
- No parse errors
- Cards render correctly

### Test 3: CRLF Line Endings

**Purpose:** Verify parser handles Windows-style line endings

```bash
# In browser: Select "CRLF Line Endings" mode
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Parser strips `\r` characters
- Event boundaries detected correctly
- No duplicate events or missed events

### Test 4: Error Mid-Stream

**Purpose:** Test error handling during streaming

```bash
# In browser: Select "Error Mid-Stream" mode
# Stream should start normally, then error during content stage
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Skeleton renders successfully
- Error event received
- Error message shown in Event Log
- Connection Status shows "Error"

### Test 5: Fast Streaming

**Purpose:** Performance test with minimal delays

```bash
# In browser: Select "Fast (no delays)" mode
# Or use delay=0 in query params
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- All events arrive rapidly
- No rendering errors
- Smooth animations
- No layout shifts

## Diagnostics

### Watch the Event Log

The test page includes a collapsible Event Log that shows:
- Event timestamps
- Event types and stages
- Chunk boundaries
- Parse errors
- Buffer diagnostics

### Console Logs

Both client and server log detailed information:

**Client Console:**
```
[CLIENT] ‚úì Parsed SSE: {eventType: 'progress', ...}
[CLIENT] ‚Üí Routing to handleMessage as progress
[CLIENT] ‚Üí SKELETON EVENT FOUND! Cards: 3
üì¶ Skeleton: mock-card-1 (hero)
```

**Server Console:**
```
[MOCK] Starting stream: 3 cards, 500ms delay, mode=chunked
[MOCK] === CHUNK #1 ===
[MOCK] Sending: progress (skeleton)
[MOCK] === CHUNK #2 ===
[MOCK] Sending: message (skeleton)
```

### Watchdog Timer

If no skeleton is rendered within 2 seconds, a watchdog logs:
- Buffer tail (last 200 chars)
- Total bytes received
- Number of chunks
- Number of events parsed

## Common Issues

### Issue: Cards don't render

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Event Log - did skeleton event arrive?
2. Look for `‚Üí SKELETON EVENT FOUND! Cards: N` in console
3. Check for JavaScript errors
4. Verify `data.cards` exists in skeleton event

### Issue: Multiple instances of same card

**Cause:** Event handler called multiple times

**Fix:** Check routing logic - ensure progress events with `stage: "skeleton"` don't trigger skeleton rendering

### Issue: Parse errors

**Cause:** Malformed JSON or incorrect line ending handling

**Fix:** Check mode selection - try "chunked" mode first

## Integration with Real API

To switch between mock and real API:

1. **Mock Server:** Select "Mock Server" in endpoint dropdown
2. **Real API:** Select "Real API" in endpoint dropdown

The test page automatically adjusts:
- Request method (GET for mock, POST for real)
- Request format (query params vs JSON body)
- Endpoint URL

## Development

### File Structure

```
tests/api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mock-sse-server.js          # Mock server implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ streaming-progressive.html   # Test page with enhanced parser
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README-MOCK-SERVER.md       # This file
```

### Modifying the Mock Server

Edit `tests/api/mock-sse-server.js` to:
- Add new test modes
- Adjust timing
- Add new event types
- Simulate different scenarios

The server uses `nodemon` in dev mode, so changes auto-restart the server.

### Adding New Test Modes

1. Add mode to `streaming-progressive.html` mock mode dropdown
2. Add case in `mock-sse-server.js` streamSequence function
3. Document the new mode in this README

## Acceptance Criteria

‚úÖ Mock server starts on port 3001
‚úÖ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
‚úÖ Skeleton arrives in chunk #2 (after progress)
‚úÖ Client parses multi-line JSON correctly
‚úÖ Client handles CRLF and LF line endings
‚úÖ Error events display correctly
‚úÖ Cards render progressively
‚úÖ No console errors
‚úÖ Event Log shows all events
‚úÖ Stats panel updates correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3001 already in use

```bash
# Kill existing process
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID <pid> /F

# macOS/Linux
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
```

### Mock server not starting

1. Check Node.js version (requires v14+)
2. Verify dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. Check for syntax errors: `node tests/api/mock-sse-server.js`

### CORS errors

The mock server includes CORS headers. If you still see CORS errors:
1. Check browser console for exact error
2. Verify request includes `Accept: text/event-stream` header
3. Try accessing from same origin (open HTML file via Vite dev server)
