# Workshop Framework

Use this framework for: hands-on training, interactive sessions, team exercises, facilitated learning.

## Structure Pattern

### Phase 1: Setup (10-15% of cards)
- **Card 1**: Welcome + Outcomes
  - What participants will accomplish today
  - Energizing, action-oriented language
  - Content type: title, concept

- **Card 2**: Agenda Overview
  - Session flow and timing
  - Balance of learn/do activities
  - Content type: process

- **Card 3** (optional): Ground Rules
  - Participation expectations
  - Safe environment for learning
  - Content type: concept

### Phase 2: Theory/Framework (20-25% of cards)
- **Concept Introduction**: The mental model or framework
  - Keep concise (participants learn by doing)
  - Focus on what they need to know to practice
  - Content type: concept, title

- **Key Principles**: Core rules or guidelines
  - 3-5 foundational ideas
  - Easy to remember and apply
  - Content type: concept

- **Demonstration**: Show it in action
  - Live demo or walkthrough
  - Annotate key decision points
  - Content type: process, image

### Phase 3: Practice Activities (40-50% of cards)
- **Activity 1 Setup**: First hands-on exercise
  - Clear instructions and success criteria
  - Time allocation
  - Content type: concept, title

- **Activity 1 Debrief**: What we learned
  - Guided reflection questions
  - Common patterns observed
  - Content type: concept, takeaway

- **Activity 2 Setup**: Second exercise (more complex)
  - Builds on Activity 1
  - Increased difficulty or scope
  - Content type: concept

- **Activity 2 Debrief**: Deeper insights
  - Connect experience to theory
  - Participant shares/examples
  - Content type: concept, quote

- **Group Discussion**: Collaborative sense-making
  - Open questions for group
  - Synthesize learnings
  - Content type: concept

### Phase 4: Integration (15-20% of cards)
- **Real-World Application**: How to use this at work
  - Specific scenarios from participants' context
  - Adaptation strategies
  - Content type: concept, process

- **Obstacles & Solutions**: Anticipate challenges
  - Common barriers to application
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Content type: comparison, concept

- **Personal Action Plan**: Individual commitment
  - What each person will try first
  - Accountability mechanism
  - Content type: concept

- **Resources & Support**: Continued learning
  - Materials, tools, community
  - Content type: concept

- **Closing Reflection**: Wrap up
  - Key takeaways
  - Appreciation and momentum
  - Content type: takeaway, title

## Narrative Arc

- **Opening**: Create psychological safety and excitement
- **Development**: Alternate between learning and doing (cycle multiple times)
- **Climax**: Breakthrough moment during practice (skill integration)
- **Closing**: Bridge to real-world application

## Card Count Guidelines

- **8-12 cards**: 90-minute workshop (1 major activity)
- **13-20 cards**: Half-day workshop (2-3 activities)
- **21-30 cards**: Full-day workshop (4-5 activities with breaks)

## Key Principles

1. **Learning by doing**: 70% practice, 30% theory
2. **Progressive difficulty**: Start simple, build complexity
3. **Fail safely**: Create low-stakes environment for experimentation
4. **Reflect always**: Debrief every activity (experience without reflection ≠ learning)
5. **Make it relevant**: Use examples from participants' world
6. **Facilitate, don't lecture**: Your role is guide, not sage
7. **Build energy**: Mix individual work, pairs, small groups, full group

## Example Card Sequence (15-card workshop)

1. Welcome - "Master design thinking in 3 hours" (title)
2. Outcomes - "You'll prototype a solution today" (concept)
3. Agenda - Four phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype (process)
4. What is design thinking - Core mindset (concept)
5. Empathy fundamentals - "Observe, engage, immerse" (concept)
6. Demo - Watch me interview a user (process)
7. Activity 1 - "Interview your partner about morning routine" (concept)
8. Debrief 1 - "What surprised you?" (concept)
9. Define the problem - From insights to problem statement (concept)
10. Activity 2 - "Write your HMW question" (concept)
11. Ideation rules - "Quantity over quality, defer judgment" (concept)
12. Activity 3 - "Generate 20 ideas in 10 minutes" (concept)
13. Debrief 2 - "Best ideas? Why?" (concept)
14. Rapid prototyping - "Make it tangible in 30 minutes" (process)
15. Closing - "Your action plan for Monday" (concept)

## Activity Design Principles

Good activities are:
- **Clear**: Unambiguous instructions
- **Bounded**: Specific constraints (time, materials, scope)
- **Purposeful**: Clear connection to learning objectives
- **Accessible**: Everyone can participate regardless of skill level
- **Debriefable**: Generate insights worth discussing

## Timing Considerations

- **Theory blocks**: 5-10 minutes per card
- **Activity setup**: 2-3 minutes
- **Activity execution**: 10-45 minutes (depending on complexity)
- **Debrief**: 5-15 minutes (match activity length)
- **Transitions**: 2-5 minutes between major sections
- **Buffer**: Add 15% extra time for discussions

## Common Mistakes

❌ Too much lecture, not enough practice
❌ Activities without clear purpose or debrief
❌ Skipping reflection to "save time"
❌ One-size-fits-all content (not adapting to group)
❌ Going too fast (rushing through insights)
❌ No connection between activities and real work
❌ Ending without action commitments
❌ Assuming everyone learns at same pace
