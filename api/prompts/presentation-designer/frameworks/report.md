# Report Framework

Use this framework for: business reviews, research findings, status updates, analytical presentations.

## Structure Pattern

### Phase 1: Executive Summary (10-15% of cards)
- **Card 1**: Title + Key Finding
  - The single most important insight
  - Lead with the conclusion
  - Content type: title, data

- **Card 2**: Summary Dashboard

  - High-level overview
  - Content type: data, dashboard

- **Card 3** (optional): Context/Scope
  - What this report covers
  - Time period, data sources, methodology
  - Content type: concept

### Phase 2: Situation Analysis (25-35% of cards)
- **Current State**: Where things stand now
  - Baseline metrics
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Content type: data, dashboard

- **Trends**: How things have changed
  - Time series analysis
  - Growth/decline patterns
  - Content type: data, comparison

- **Breakdown by Segment**: Detailed views
  - By category, geography, product, etc.
  - Identify outliers or patterns
  - Content type: data, comparison

- **Comparative Context**: Benchmarks
  - vs. targets, competitors, previous periods
  - Content type: comparison, data

### Phase 3: Analysis & Insights (30-40% of cards)
- **Key Finding 1**: Deep dive on important pattern
  - What the data reveals
  - Why it matters
  - Content type: data, concept

- **Key Finding 2-N**: Additional insights
  - Supporting evidence
  - Cause-effect relationships
  - Content type: data, concept, comparison

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Why things happened
  - Underlying drivers
  - Contributing factors
  - Content type: process, concept

- **Risks & Opportunities**: Forward-looking assessment
  - What could go wrong/right
  - Content type: concept, comparison

### Phase 4: Recommendations (15-20% of cards)
- **Recommendation 1**: Specific action
  - Clear, actionable proposal
  - Expected impact
  - Content type: concept, title

- **Recommendation 2-N**: Additional actions
  - Prioritized by impact/effort
  - Content type: concept

- **Implementation Plan**: How to execute
  - Timeline, owners, milestones
  - Content type: process

- **Success Metrics**: How to measure progress
  - KPIs to track
  - Content type: data, concept

- **Next Steps**: Immediate actions
  - What happens after this presentation
  - Content type: concept

## Narrative Arc

- **Opening**: Lead with the headline finding (inverted pyramid style)
- **Development**: Build understanding through data → insights → implications
- **Climax**: The critical insight that drives recommendations
- **Closing**: Clear action plan with accountability

## Card Count Guidelines

- **5-8 cards**: Executive brief (summary → one key insight → recommendation)
- **10-15 cards**: Standard report (summary → analysis → 2-3 recommendations)
- **16-30 cards**: Comprehensive report (full situation analysis → multiple insights → detailed action plan)

## Key Principles

1. **Lead with conclusions**: Busy executives need answers first
2. **Show your work**: Follow conclusions with supporting data
3. **Visualize data**: Charts > tables > text
4. **Tell the story in the data**: Don't just show numbers, interpret them
5. **Be objective**: Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
6. **Make recommendations actionable**: Specific, measurable, assigned

## Example Card Sequence (12-card quarterly review)

1. Executive summary - "Revenue up 23%, but churn doubled" (title/data)
2. Key metrics dashboard - All critical KPIs (dashboard)
3. Revenue trends - "Growth driven by enterprise segment" (data)
4. User acquisition - "CAC decreased 15%" (data)
5. Churn analysis - "Churn concentrated in SMB tier" (data)
6. Cohort retention - "Month 3 drop-off pattern" (data)
7. Key insight - "Poor onboarding = churn driver" (concept)
8. Root cause - "SMBs lack dedicated support" (concept)
9. Competitive context - "We're losing to Competitor X" (comparison)
10. Recommendation 1 - "Launch SMB success program" (concept)
11. Recommendation 2 - "Revamp onboarding flow" (concept)
12. Implementation roadmap - Q3-Q4 timeline (process)

## Data Visualization Guidelines

Choose appropriate chart types:
- **Trends over time**: Line charts
- **Comparisons**: Bar charts
- **Composition**: Pie/stacked bar (use sparingly)
- **Relationships**: Scatter plots
- **Multiple metrics**: Dashboards with small multiples
- **Hierarchies**: Treemaps, sunburst charts

## Common Mistakes

❌ Burying the lead (saving key finding for the end)
❌ Data dumps without interpretation
❌ Charts that are too complex or cluttered
❌ Recommendations without supporting analysis
❌ Vague suggestions ("improve customer experience")
❌ No clear owners or timelines for actions
❌ Ignoring unfavorable data or limitations
❌ Too much methodology, not enough insights
