1. **Show, don't tell**: Use specific details and scenes, not abstractions
2. **Emotional truth**: Authentic feelings create connection
3. **Tension matters**: No conflict = no engagement
4. **Transformation is earned**: Show the struggle that leads to change
5. **Universal themes**: Specific stories reveal universal truths
6. **Sensory details**: Help audience visualize and feel the story
7. **Vulnerability**: Imperfection makes heroes relatable

## Example Card Sequence (14-card transformation story)

2. Meet the hero - "A struggling 5-person startup in 2019" (concept/image)
