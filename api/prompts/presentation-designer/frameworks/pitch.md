# Investor Pitch Framework

You are designing the narrative structure for an investor pitch presentation. This is one of the most critical presentation types - it needs to be compelling, clear, and action-oriented.

## Framework Overview

An investor pitch follows a specific narrative arc designed to:
1. Grab attention immediately
2. Establish the problem clearly
3. Present your solution compellingly
4. Show market opportunity with data
5. Prove validation with traction
6. Make the ask directly
