# Education Framework

Use this framework for: training sessions, tutorials, explainer presentations, lectures.

## Structure Pattern

### Phase 1: Foundation (15-20% of cards)
- **Card 1**: Hook - Why this matters to learners
  - Connect to their goals or pain points
  - Content type: title, quote, or concept

- **Card 2**: Learning Objectives - What they'll be able to do
  - Concrete, measurable outcomes
  - Use action verbs (build, analyze, create)
  - Content type: title or concept

- **Card 3** (optional): Prerequisites/Context - What they need to know first
  - Brief review of assumed knowledge
  - Content type: concept

### Phase 2: Teach (40-50% of cards)
- **Concept Introduction**: Present new idea in simplest form
  - One concept per card
  - Use analogies or metaphors
  - Content type: concept, title

- **Deep Dive**: Explain mechanics or details
  - Break complex ideas into components
  - Use diagrams, processes, or comparisons
  - Content type: process, comparison, concept

- **Example/Demonstration**: Show it in action
  - Real-world application
  - Walk through specific case
  - Content type: image, process, data

- **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid
  - Address typical mistakes proactively
  - Content type: comparison, concept

### Phase 3: Apply (20-30% of cards)
- **Practice Scenario**: Challenge to test understanding
  - Hands-on activity or thought experiment
  - Content type: concept, process

- **Guided Solution**: Walk through the answer
  - Step-by-step approach
  - Highlight decision points
  - Content type: process, concept

- **Extensions**: Advanced applications
  - How to go deeper
  - Related concepts
  - Content type: concept

### Phase 4: Reinforce (10-15% of cards)
- **Key Takeaways**: Summarize essential points
  - 3-5 core concepts
  - Content type: takeaway, concept

- **Next Steps**: How to continue learning
  - Resources, practice suggestions
  - Content type: concept

- **Recap/Quiz** (optional): Test retention
  - Quick knowledge check
  - Content type: concept

## Narrative Arc

- **Opening**: Spark curiosity and establish relevance
- **Development**: Layer concepts progressively from simple to complex
- **Climax**: Moment of understanding (the "aha" moment)
- **Closing**: Reinforcement and path forward

## Card Count Guidelines

- **5-8 cards**: Single concept with one example (microlearning)
- **10-15 cards**: Complete topic with multiple examples and practice
- **16-30 cards**: Comprehensive training with multiple concepts and scenarios

## Key Principles

1. **Scaffold learning**: Build on what they already know
2. **Show examples early**: Concrete before abstract
3. **Check understanding**: Include reflection or practice opportunities
4. **Repeat key concepts**: Introduce, apply, summarize
5. **Minimize cognitive load**: One new idea per card
6. **Use multiple representations**: Vary between text, visuals, examples

## Example Card Sequence (10-card tutorial)

1. Hook - "Why async/await changed JavaScript" (title)
2. Learning objectives - "You'll build async functions with confidence" (concept)
3. The problem - "Callback hell example" (image/code)
4. Concept intro - "Promises make async code readable" (concept)
5. How it works - "Promise lifecycle: pending → fulfilled/rejected" (process)
6. Example 1 - "Fetching data with async/await" (process)
7. Common mistakes - "Forgetting to await" (comparison)
8. Practice - "Convert this callback to async/await" (concept)
9. Solution - "Here's how..." (process)
10. Takeaways - "Three rules for async code" (takeaway)

## Content Type Distribution

Vary content types to maintain engagement:
- 30-40%: Concepts/explanations
- 20-30%: Processes/how-tos
- 20-30%: Examples/demonstrations
- 10-20%: Practice/interaction

## Common Mistakes

❌ Too much theory before showing practical application
❌ Skipping the "why should I care" motivation
❌ Assuming too much prior knowledge
❌ No opportunities for practice or reflection
❌ Ending without clear next steps
❌ Information density too high (cognitive overload)
❌ All text, no visuals or examples
