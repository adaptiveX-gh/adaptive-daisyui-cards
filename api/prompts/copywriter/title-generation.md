# Title Generation Guide

Titles are the most important copy element. They must capture attention and communicate the core message instantly.

## Title Principles

1. **Standalone clarity**: Title should make sense without context
2. **Specific over vague**: "Reduce churn 40%" > "Better retention"
3. **Active over passive**: "We rebuilt our stack" > "The stack was rebuilt"
4. **Concrete over abstract**: "Ship every Friday" > "Increase velocity"
5. **Short over long**: 3-8 words is ideal, 10 max

## Title Formulas

### 1. The Question
Opens curiosity loop that body copy closes.

**Examples**:
- "Why Do Container Queries Matter?"
- "What If Media Queries Aren't Enough?"
- "Are You Making This CSS Mistake?"

**When to use**: Opening cards, problem statements, engagement hooks
**When to avoid**: Closing cards (don't end on question), data cards (just state the insight)

### 2. The Number
Concrete specificity builds credibility.

**Examples**:
- "3 Rules for Responsive Components"
- "92% Faster Page Loads"
- "From $0 to $2M in 18 Months"

**When to use**: Data cards, list cards, result cards
**When to avoid**: Emotional moments, concept introduction (numbers can feel reductive)

### 3. The Bold Claim
Provocation demands attention.

**Examples**:
- "Media Queries Are Dead"
- "Your Testing Strategy Is Wrong"
- "We Rewrote Everything in 30 Days"

**When to use**: Opening hooks, transition cards, manifesto moments
**When to avoid**: If you can't back it up, professional/conservative audiences

### 4. The How-To
Promise of practical value.

**Examples**:
- "How to Build Fluid Typography"
- "How We Cut Costs 70%"
- "How to Scale Without Breaking"

**When to use**: Educational content, process explanations, case studies
**When to avoid**: High-level strategic content, inspirational moments

### 5. The Transformation
Before → After creates compelling narrative.

**Examples**:
- "From Chaos to Clarity"
- "Manual Reviews to AI-Powered Insights"
- "4-Day Deploys to 4-Minute Deploys"

**When to use**: Case studies, result cards, journey narratives
**When to avoid**: Opening cards (no context yet), data-heavy cards

### 6. The Urgency
Time or scarcity creates action bias.

**Examples**:
- "The Window Is Closing"
- "Change This Today"
- "What You're Missing Right Now"

**When to use**: Closing cards, call-to-action cards, problem urgency
**When to avoid**: Overuse (loses impact), educational content (feels pushy)

### 7. The Insight
Share wisdom earned.

**Examples**:
- "Design Systems Don't Scale Teams Do"
- "Speed Matters More Than Features"
- "The Best Code Is No Code"

**When to use**: Takeaway cards, wisdom moments, principle statements
**When to avoid**: Opening (no context), when insight isn't supported yet

### 8. The Contrast
Juxtaposition reveals truth.

**Examples**:
- "Ship Fast Break Things Learn Faster"
- "Build Less Ship More"
- "Local First Cloud Native"

**When to use**: Philosophy cards, approach cards, positioning
**When to avoid**: Complex ideas (contrast can oversimplify)

## Title Writing Process

### Step 1: Extract Core Message
"Container queries let components respond to their container size instead of viewport size"

### Step 2: Identify Key Tension/Value
- Tension: Media queries don't work for components
- Value: True component-level responsiveness

### Step 3: Try Multiple Formulas

**Question**: "Why Can't Components Be Responsive?"
**Bold Claim**: "Container Queries Fix Media Queries"
**How-To**: "How to Build Context-Aware Components"
**Insight**: "Components Don't Know Their Context"
**Transformation**: "From Viewport-Aware to Container-Aware"

### Step 4: Choose Best Fit for Role/Tone

For opening card: "Why Can't Components Be Responsive?" (engages)
For concept card: "Components Don't Know Their Context" (insight)
For how-to card: "How to Build Context-Aware Components" (practical)

### Step 5: Refine for Brevity

"How to Build Context-Aware Components" (7 words)
→ "Build Context-Aware Components" (4 words, more direct)

## Title Length Guidelines

### 3-4 words: Maximum Impact
- "Container Queries Explained"
- "We Were Wrong"
- "The Only Metric That Matters"
- **Best for**: Hero layouts, climax cards, minimal tone

### 5-7 words: Balanced
- "Five Lessons from Our Biggest Failure"
- "How Container Queries Change Responsive Design"
- "The Problem with Current Code Review"
- **Best for**: Most situations, flexible

### 8-10 words: Detail
- "What We Learned Interviewing 100 Churned Customers"
- "The Simple Change That Doubled Our Conversion Rate"
- **Best for**: Story cards, specific claims, when context is needed

### 11+ words: Too Long
❌ "A Comprehensive Overview of the Various Approaches to Implementing..."
❌ Fix by cutting or splitting into title + subtitle

## Title + Subtitle Combinations

Sometimes you need both for clarity.

### Pattern 1: Statement + Clarification
**Title**: "Container Queries Are Here"
**Subtitle**: "Build components that respond to their container, not the viewport"

### Pattern 2: Question + Answer
**Title**: "Why Did We Fail?"
**Subtitle**: "We built features no one wanted"

### Pattern 3: Claim + Evidence
**Title**: "Manual Review Doesn't Scale"
**Subtitle**: "Senior devs spend 30% of time reviewing, not building"

### Pattern 4: Hook + Context
**Title**: "We Were 72 Hours from Bankruptcy"
**Subtitle**: "The brutal week that saved our company"

## Tone Variations

Same message, different tones:

### Professional
"Reducing Customer Acquisition Cost 45%"
"Strategic Approach to Container Queries"
"Evidence-Based Product Development"

### Creative
"We Cracked the CAC Code"
"Container Queries: The Layout Revolution"
"Build What People Actually Want"

### Minimal
"45% Lower CAC"
"Components, Meet Containers"
"Talk to Users"

## Title Testing Questions

Ask yourself:
1. **Does it make sense without the card?** (standalone test)
2. **Would you click it?** (curiosity test)
3. **Is every word necessary?** (brevity test)
4. **Does it match the tone?** (consistency test)
5. **Can you say it in one breath?** (natural language test)

If any answer is "no", revise.

## Common Title Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Abstract
"Optimizing the Development Lifecycle"
**Fix**: "Ship Every Friday" (concrete)

### ❌ Mistake 2: Too Long
"The Complete Guide to Everything You Need to Know About Container Queries"
**Fix**: "Container Queries Explained"

### ❌ Mistake 3: Passive Voice
"Mistakes Were Made in Our Launch"
**Fix**: "How We Botched Our Launch"

### ❌ Mistake 4: Jargon Without Cause
"Leveraging Synergistic Paradigms"
**Fix**: Literally anything else

### ❌ Mistake 5: Burying the Lead
"Some Thoughts on Our Recent Findings Regarding User Behavior"
**Fix**: "Users Don't Read Your Content"

### ❌ Mistake 6: Generic Placeholder
"Introduction"
"Overview"
"Background"
**Fix**: Use actual content ("The Problem We're Solving", "What You Need to Know")

## Special Case: Data Titles

When the number is the story:

**Pattern 1: Just the Number**
"92%"
(Context in subtitle: "of bugs caught before production")

**Pattern 2: Number + Context**
"3x Faster Deployments"
"$2M ARR in 12 Months"

**Pattern 3: Comparison**
"4 Days → 4 Minutes"
"Before: 60% | After: 92%"

**Key**: Let the number breathe. Don't bury it in text.

## Special Case: Quote Titles

When using a quote as title:

**Full Quote** (short quotes only)
"The best way to predict the future is to create it."

**Excerpt** (if quote is long)
"The best way to predict the future..."
(Full quote in body)

**Attribution** (in subtitle or body)
"— Peter Drucker"

**Key**: Quote must be powerful enough to stand as title. If it's just "nice", use it in body instead.

## Title Evolution Example

**V1**: "An Exploration of the Benefits and Implementation Strategies of CSS Container Queries in Modern Responsive Web Design"
(23 words - way too long, academic, boring)

**V2**: "How to Use Container Queries for Responsive Design"
(8 words - better but generic)

**V3**: "Container Queries: Responsive Components, Not Just Pages"
(7 words - more specific, shows the key benefit)

**V4**: "Build Components That Know Their Context"
(6 words - active voice, benefit-focused, intriguing)

**V5**: "Components That Know Their Context"
(5 words - even tighter, still clear)

**Final choice depends on**:
- Layout (hero = shorter, sidebar = can be longer)
- Tone (minimal = V5, professional = V3)
- Audience (beginners = explicit "container queries", advanced = implied)
