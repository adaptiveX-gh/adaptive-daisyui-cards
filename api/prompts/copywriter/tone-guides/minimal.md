# Minimal Tone Guide

Use this tone for: Startup culture, tech products, design-forward brands, developer tools, modern SaaS, portfolio work.

## Characteristics

- **Ruthlessly concise**: Every word earns its place
- **Direct**: No preamble, no fluff
- **Clear over clever**: Simple trumps smart
- **Space as design**: White space is a feature
- **Implication over explanation**: Trust audience to connect dots
- **Modern**: Contemporary language and references

## Philosophy

Less text = more impact. Minimal doesn't mean empty‚Äîit means intentional. Every word must be load-bearing.

## Language Patterns

### Word Choice

**Prefer**:
- Short words: Build, ship, fix, make, learn
- Concrete nouns: Code, users, data, product
- Strong verbs: Cut, add, merge, deploy
- Numbers: 3x, 92%, $2M (specific > vague)

**Avoid**:
- Qualifiers: very, really, quite, somewhat, fairly
- Filler: in order to, due to the fact that, at this point in time
- Abstractions: leverage, utilize, facilitate, enable
- Buzzwords: synergy, paradigm, ecosystem, holistic

### Sentence Structure
- Short. Often fragments.
- One idea per sentence
- Subject + verb + object (simple structure)
- Remove unnecessary words
- Cut first, ask questions later

### Formality Level
**Minimal**: "3x faster. $0 config."
**Too Verbose**: "Our solution delivers three times the performance with zero configuration overhead."
**Too Terse**: "3x. 0."

## Title Examples

### Opening Titles
- "Build. Ship. Learn."
- "The Problem"
- "Why This Matters"
- "Start Here"

### Problem Titles
- "Broken Workflows"
- "The Bottleneck"
- "What's Wrong"
- "Current State"

### Solution Titles
- "The Fix"
- "How It Works"
- "New Approach"
- "Better Way"

### Data Titles
- "92%"
- "3x Faster"
- "Results"
- "$0 ‚Üí $2M"

### Closing Titles
- "Next Steps"
- "Get Started"
- "Ship It"
- "Try It Free"

## Body Copy Examples

### Example 1: Problem
```
Title: "The Bottleneck"

Code review takes 18 hours.

Developers wait. Context switches. Productivity drops.

Senior engineers spend 30% of time reviewing. Not building.

Critical bugs slip through anyway.
```

**Why this works**:
- Each sentence = one fact
- No filler words
- Clear problem in 20 words
- Implies solution needed

### Example 2: Solution
```
Title: "The Fix"

AI reviews code in 2 minutes.

Catches 92% of bugs. Explains issues clearly. Learns your patterns.

Developers ship faster. Seniors build more. Bugs stay out of production.
```

**Why this works**:
- Parallel structure
- Benefit-focused
- Numbers as proof
- 25 words total

### Example 3: How It Works
```
Title: "How It Works"

1. Push code
2. AI analyzes
3. Get feedback
4. Fix issues
5. Ship

### Example 4: Results
```
Title: "Results"

Before: 18hr review time
After: 2min review time

Before: 60% bug detection
After: 92% bug detection

Before: 40 bugs in production
After: 3 bugs in production
```

**Why this works**:
- Before/after structure
- Data speaks
- No explanation needed
- Pattern is clear

### Example 5: Call to Action
```
Title: "Get Started"

## Layout-Specific Copy

### Hero Layout (Minimal Style)
```
Title: "Ship Daily"

Body: [empty or single line]
"Code review in 2 minutes."
```

### Sidebar Layout (Minimal Style)
```
Title: "Container Queries"

Body:
Components respond to container size.
Not viewport size.

Write once. Works everywhere.
```

### Split Layout (Minimal Style)
```
Title: "Before ‚Üí After"

Left:
Media queries
Viewport-based
Context-blind
Manual breakpoints

Right:
Container queries
Container-based
Context-aware
Auto-adaptive
```

### Feature Layout (Minimal Style)
```
Title: "Why CodeGuard"

‚ö° Fast: 2min reviews
üõ°Ô∏è Smart: 92% detection
üß† Learning: Adapts to your code

```

## Tone Techniques

### Technique 1: Fragment Power
```
The problem? Slow reviews.
The solution? AI analysis.
The result? Ship faster.
```

### Technique 2: Parallel Lists
```
Build fast.
Test thoroughly.
Ship confidently.
```

### Technique 3: Stripped Sentences
**Before**: "We are able to reduce the time it takes to review code"
**After**: "Review code 90% faster"

**Before**: "The system has the capability to detect bugs"
**After**: "Detects 92% of bugs"

### Technique 4: Let Data Speak
```
Numbers:

18hrs ‚Üí 2min (reviews)
60% ‚Üí 92% (detection)
$1.2M ‚Üí $0 (bug costs)
```

### Technique 5: White Space as Punctuation
```
The problem:

Slow reviews.

The solution:

AI.

The result:

Ship faster.
```

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Write Normally
"Our AI-powered code review solution is able to analyze pull requests and provide detailed feedback in an average time of just 2 minutes."

### Step 2: Cut Filler
"AI code review analyzes pull requests and provides feedback in 2 minutes."

### Step 3: Remove Obvious Words
"AI reviews code in 2 minutes."

### Step 4: Test if Shorter Works
"Code review in 2 minutes."

### Step 5: Evaluate Trade-offs
- Does "code review" need "AI"? Context dependent.
- Is "2 minutes" clearer than "2min"? Consistency check.
- Can title carry more weight? Consider moving to title.

**Final**: Context determines optimal compression level.

## Tone Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Too Verbose
"Our innovative solution leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to facilitate the optimization of code review processes, enabling development teams to achieve higher productivity levels."

**Fix**: "AI reviews code 10x faster."

### ‚ùå Too Cryptic
"92."

**Fix**: "92% bug detection"

### ‚ùå Corporate Speak
"Utilizing our platform enables stakeholders to optimize workflows."

**Fix**: "Ship faster. Ship better."

### ‚ùå Explaining the Obvious
"As you can see from the data, the numbers clearly indicate..."

**Fix**: [Just show the data]

## Word Budget Guidelines

Aim for these maximums:

- **Hero title**: 3-5 words
- **Hero subtitle**: 5-8 words
- **Hero body**: 0-10 words (often zero)
- **Sidebar title**: 2-4 words
- **Sidebar body**: 20-40 words
- **Feature item**: Name (2-3 words) + Description (4-8 words)
- **Bullet point**: 3-7 words
- **Call to action**: 2-4 words

## Compression Examples

### Example A
**Verbose (42 words)**:
"Our comprehensive analysis of the situation has revealed that the implementation of container queries as opposed to traditional media queries provides developers with the ability to create components that are able to respond more effectively to their immediate container context."

**Minimal (7 words)**:
"Container queries: Components respond to container, not viewport."

### Example B
**Verbose (28 words)**:
"By utilizing our AI-powered code review platform, development teams can significantly reduce the amount of time spent waiting for manual code reviews while simultaneously improving bug detection rates."

**Minimal (8 words)**:
"AI reviews code in 2 minutes. Catches 92% of bugs."

### Example C
**Verbose (35 words)**:
"After conducting extensive customer research interviews with approximately 50 individuals who had previously churned from our platform, we discovered that there was a common pattern in their feedback regarding feature complexity and overall product utility."

**Minimal (13 words)**:
"Interviewed 50 churned customers. Pattern: They needed one feature. We had 50."

## Testing Minimal Copy

### The Half Test
Can you cut 50% of words and keep the meaning?
- If yes: You weren't minimal enough
- If no: You're probably there

### The Skim Test
Read only first word of each sentence/bullet.
Do you still get the message?
- If yes: Strong structure
- If no: Front-load more

### The Twitter Test
Could this fit in a tweet (280 chars)?
- If yes: Probably minimal
- If no: Keep cutting

### The Breath Test
Can you read it aloud in one breath?
- If yes: Good rhythm
- If no: Consider breaking up or cutting

## Remember

Minimal isn't about being clever with brevity. It's about respecting your audience's time.

Every word removed is a gift to your reader.

But don't remove so much that meaning breaks. Minimal is clear. Cryptic is not.

Cut until it hurts. Then cut one more word. Then add back what's truly necessary.
