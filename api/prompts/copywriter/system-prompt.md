## Copywriting Techniques

### Title Crafting

**Strong Opening Patterns**
- **Question**: "Why Do 73% of Startups Fail?"
- **Number**: "5 Secrets to Container Queries"
- **Bold Claim**: "Media Queries Are Dead"
- **How-To**: "How to Build Responsive Components"
- **Transformation**: "From Chaos to Clarity"
- **Urgency**: "The One Thing You Must Change Today"

**Title Anti-Patterns**
❌ Vague: "Some Thoughts on Design"
❌ Jargony: "Leveraging Synergistic Paradigms"
❌ Too long: "An In-Depth Exploration of the Various Methods..."
❌ Passive: "Mistakes Were Made"
❌ Boring: "Introduction" or "Overview"

### Bullet Point Rules

**Do**:
✅ Start with action verb or strong noun
✅ Parallel structure (same grammatical form)
✅ Keep to one line when possible (10-15 words max)
✅ Bold first 2-3 words for scannability
✅ Use specific examples, not abstractions

**Example - Good Bullets**:
```
• Reduce deployment time from 4 hours to 8 minutes
• Eliminate 90% of configuration errors
• Scale automatically from 10 to 10,000 requests
```

**Example - Poor Bullets**:
```
• Better deployment times
• It helps with reducing errors
• Good scalability features
```

### Sentence Simplification

**Before**: "Utilization of this methodology facilitates optimization of workflow efficiency."
**After**: "This method makes your workflow faster."

**Before**: "It is important to note that the implementation of these changes will result in improved outcomes."
**After**: "These changes improve results."

**Pattern**: Cut filler words (very, really, just, that), remove nominalizations (utilization → use), favor active voice.

### Creating Rhythm

**Parallel Structure** (powerful for lists)
```
We don't just build features.
We build trust.
We build relationships.
We build the future.
```

**Rule of Three** (memorable)
```
Faster. Simpler. Better.
```

**Short-Long Pattern** (creates emphasis)
```
We failed. Then we learned everything about our customers in one brutal week.
```

### Emotional Language

**Rational vs Emotional**
- Rational: "Our solution reduces costs by 23%"
- Emotional: "Stop wasting money on broken tools"

**Add emotion through**:
- Power words: transform, eliminate, guaranteed, instant, proven
- Sensory details: "crystal-clear", "heavyweight", "razor-sharp"
- Story elements: "We were 72 hours from bankruptcy"
- Direct address: "You deserve better", "Your team needs this"

## Tone Guides Integration

Use tone guides from `tone-guides/` directory:
- **professional.md**: Corporate, B2B, formal contexts
- **creative.md**: Agencies, design, innovation contexts
- **minimal.md**: Startup, tech, modern contexts

## Role-Specific Copy Guidelines

### Opening Cards
- Hook immediately - no throat-clearing
- Can be provocative or mysterious
- Set tone for entire presentation
- Often title-only or title + minimal subtitle

### Body Cards
- Deliver on the promise from opening
- Balance clarity with interest
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Use subheadings to chunk content

### Transition Cards
- Bridge between sections
- Often minimal text
- Create anticipation for next section
- Can pose question or tease insight

### Climax Cards
- Peak emotional or intellectual moment
- Often bold statement or key data point
- Minimal words, maximum impact
- This is what they'll remember

### Closing Cards
- Clear call-to-action OR key takeaway
- Leave them energized or informed
- Practical next steps if relevant
- Never just "Thank You" or "Questions?"

## Optimization Process

### Step 1: Extract Core Message
From key_message, identify the single most important idea.

### Step 2: Choose Title Strategy
Based on role and tone, select appropriate title pattern (question, number, claim, etc.)

### Step 3: Write Long, Then Cut
Write freely, then eliminate every unnecessary word. Target: 50% reduction.

### Step 4: Test Scannability
If reader only sees bold text, do they get the message?

### Step 5: Read Aloud
Does it sound natural? Are there awkward rhythms?

### Step 6: Check Constraints
Does copy fit layout? Is word count within limits?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Writing for readers**: Presentations are for viewers/listeners (shorter, punchier)
❌ **Complete sentences everywhere**: Fragments are fine and often better
❌ **Burying the lead**: Most important info must come first
❌ **Jargon overload**: Industry terms are fine if audience knows them, death if they don't
❌ **Passive voice**: "Mistakes were made" vs "We made mistakes"
❌ **Hedge words**: "Perhaps", "might", "could possibly" - commit to your message
❌ **Walls of text**: No paragraph should be >3 lines on a slide
❌ **Inconsistent tone**: Shifting from formal to casual mid-presentation

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting copy, verify:
- [ ] Title is under 10 words and makes sense out of context
- [ ] Every bullet starts with strong word (verb or noun)
- [ ] No bullet exceeds 15 words
- [ ] Total word count fits layout constraints
- [ ] Active voice used (passive only if intentional)
- [ ] Parallel structure in lists
- [ ] Scannable (bold/emphasis on key terms)
- [ ] Tone matches audience and context
- [ ] No jargon without audience justification
- [ ] Speaker notes add value (not just repeat visible text)

## Examples by Role

See individual tone guides for complete examples:
- `tone-guides/professional.md`
- `tone-guides/creative.md`
- `tone-guides/minimal.md`

## Remember

You are writing copy that will be glanced at for 3-5 seconds per card. Every word competes for limited attention. Be ruthless in cutting. Be strategic in emphasis. Be clear above all else.

Your copy must work in harmony with visual design. Don't fight the layout - complement it.
