## Epic: Intelligent Content-to-Visual Translation System

### Epic Description
Build a system that automatically analyzes content structure and semantics to render it in the most appropriate visual format without requiring manual design decisions from users.

### Business Value
- Reduces time from idea to visual by 80%
- Eliminates need for design expertise
- Ensures consistent visual quality across all content
- Adapts automatically to different viewing contexts

## User Story: Auto-Layout Content Renderer

**As a** content creator  
**I want** my text/data to automatically render in the appropriate visual layout  
**So that** I can focus on my message rather than design decisions

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Content Analysis & Layout Detection
**Given** content with the following structures  
**When** the system receives the content  
**Then** it should automatically select the correct layout:

- Content with bullet points (3+ items) → Split layout (text left, image space right)
- Content with feature list (title + description pairs) → Feature grid layout
- Content with metrics (label + value + change) → Dashboard layout  
- Content with only title + subtitle → Hero layout
- Content with process steps → Split layout (image space left, text right)

#### AC2: Content Normalization
**Given** content with inconsistent property names  
**When** the system processes the content  
**Then** it should normalize all variations:

- `items`, `features`, `cells` → normalized to `cells`
- `intro`, `body`, `description` → normalized to `body`
- `data`, `metrics`, `stats` → normalized to `metrics`
- String arrays that should be objects → parsed correctly
- Stringified JSON → automatically parsed

#### AC3: Progressive Rendering
**Given** content streaming via SSE in chunks  
**When** partial content is received  
**Then** the system should:

- Accumulate content until complete
- Not show broken/partial layouts
- Display loading state during accumulation
- Render complete card once all sections received
- Handle out-of-order content chunks

#### AC4: Responsive Adaptation
**Given** a rendered card in any layout  
**When** the container size changes  
**Then** the layout should adapt:

- Split layout: Side-by-side → Stacked (at <600px container width)
- Feature grid: 3 columns → 2 columns → 1 column
- Dashboard metrics: Horizontal → Vertical
- Typography scales based on container size
- All transitions smooth/animated

#### AC5: Error Recovery
**Given** malformed or unexpected content  
**When** the system attempts to render  
**Then** it should:

- Log specific error details for debugging
- Attempt to render with partial content (graceful degradation)
- Never show empty cards or broken layouts
- Provide fallback to simple text layout if structure unrecognized
- Not crash or block subsequent content

#### AC6: Visual Consistency
**Given** multiple cards with different layouts  
**When** rendered in sequence  
**Then** all cards should:

- Use consistent spacing and typography scale
- Apply the same theme (colors, borders, shadows)
- Maintain uniform animation timing
- Align to the same grid system
- Have consistent interactive states (hover, focus)

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass automated tests
- [ ] System handles 100 cards without performance degradation
- [ ] Renders correctly on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] Loading time <100ms for standard card
- [ ] Documentation includes examples for each layout type

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing SSE streaming infrastructure
- Cannot require server-side rendering
- Must support DaisyUI theming system
- Should not require external dependencies beyond current stack

### Out of Scope
- Manual layout override UI (future story)
- Custom layout creation (future epic)  
- PDF/PowerPoint export (separate epic)
- Real-time collaborative editing (separate epic)

### Test Scenarios

```javascript
// Test Case 1: Bullet points auto-select split layout
input: {
  title: "Benefits",
  bullets: ["Fast", "Reliable", "Scalable"]
}
expected: Split layout with bullets on left

// Test Case 2: Metrics auto-select dashboard
input: {
  title: "Q4 Results",
  metrics: [{label: "Revenue", value: "$1M", change: "+15%"}]
}
expected: Dashboard layout with metric cards

// Test Case 3: Mixed content normalizes correctly
input: {
  title: "Features",
  items: [{title: "AI", description: "Smart"}], // should become cells
  intro: "Overview text" // should become body
}
expected: Feature layout with normalized properties
```

### Dependencies
- Content generation API must provide structured JSON
- Container query CSS support (or polyfill)
- SSE connection management

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Ambiguous content could match multiple layouts
  - **Mitigation:** Define clear priority order for layout detection
- **Risk:** Performance issues with many cards
  - **Mitigation:** Implement virtual scrolling for large sets
- **Risk:** SSE connection drops during streaming
  - **Mitigation:** Implement reconnection and resume logic
